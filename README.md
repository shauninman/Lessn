# Lessn is an extremely simple, personal url shortener 
  written in PHP with MySQL and mod_rewrite.

## Installation

1. Open /lessn/-/config.php in a plaintext editor and
   create a Lessn username and password then enter your
   database connection details.

2. Upload the entire /lessn/ directory to your server. 
   For the shortest urls, place it at the root of your 
   site and rename to a single character. 
   Example: http://doma.in/x/

3. Visit http://doma.in/x/ to see all Lessn urls or jump to 
   Lessn a new url and grab the bookmarklets (the required 
   database table is created automatically the first time 
   you visit Lessn).

### NOTE:

   If your Lessn'd urls aren't working you probably didn't
   upload the .htaccess file. Enable "Show invisible files" 
   in your FTP application.

# Other Notes
Lessn is offered as-is, sans support and without warranty.
